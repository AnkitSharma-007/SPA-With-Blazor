# SPA-With-Blazor

In this article, we are going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) using Razor pages in Blazor with the help of Entity Framework Core database first approach. Single-Page Applications are web application that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. We will be creating a sample Employee Record Management System and perform CRUD operations on it.

We will be using Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server 2017.

Take a look at the final application.
